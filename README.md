Data Companion is used to automate the process of formatting csv files. Upon first run, a Data Companion directory is created in your 'My Documents'. Place any number of csv files with the folder and click 'Load Document' to populate the drop down box. Choose a document, and click the load document button again to enable the configuration selection. Create a new configuration to enable the configuration manager. Here you can select each individual column in the csv and dictate which transformation options should be applied. Clicking 'Transform Document' will then produce a properly formatted output file in the Output directory.
